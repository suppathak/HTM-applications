# HTM Applications

The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm is based on the well understood principles and core building blocks of the [Thousand Brains Theory](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-021-04715-0.pdf), which is the core-model based, sensory-motor framework of intelligence putting together the neuroscience research developed at [Numenta](https://numenta.com/) founded by Jeff hawkings. It aims to reflect the functioning of the human cortex. It focusses on three main properties: _sequence learning_, _continual learning_, and _sparse distributed representations_.

The project aims to explore the applications of HTM primarily focussing on [**Anomaly Detection**](https://numenta.com/assets/pdf/whitepapers/Numenta%20White%20Paper%20-%20Science%20of%20Anomaly%20Detection.pdf) technique.

The related upstream repo for the projects are:

- [**htm.core**](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core)
